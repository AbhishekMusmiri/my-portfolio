      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate computer science graduate who thrives in challenging environments. 
        With a strong command over Java and SQL, I specialize in backend development and 
        system design. I enjoy solving real-world problems through elegant code and clean architecture. 
        I am a quick learner and an effective communicator who believes in teamwork and continuous improvement. 
        Outside of coding, I enjoy reading about emerging tech and working on personal side projects. 
        I believe every problem has a solution — it's just a matter of perspective. 
        My curiosity drives me to explore and experiment with new tools and frameworks. 
        I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer. 
        I’m also deeply committed to building user-friendly and efficient software systems. 
        Let’s build something amazing together!
